README:

The following files are compressed in this folder:
- Group_22_IN4387_project - the report for the project
- .mclr2 file - The source code for generating the model of the system

The lts file generated from the code has been used to visualize the system using ltsview, and the screenshot has been included in the report. This is the first version of the system, and certainly needs to be improved in the forthcoming days; however, a preliminary visual analysis shows that there are no deadlocks in the system.

The mcf files are written so as to be run one by one for the various requirement tests. However, owing to a lack of time, we were unable to verify our system against the tests and hence haven't included in the submission. We shall be performing those before the final submission, and making changes to our model based on requirement failures, and uploading in the final submission.
