System Validation project feedback action items:

1. Move system components to a different chapter; it shouldn't be included in system requirements.
2. Need to explicitly what are the state controllers and what the function of each controller is.
3. In the "components" chapter we also need to include all the assumptions we're making, including the precedence of airlocks/robots.
4. Include a requirement that states that the system should be deadlock-free. It should be verifiable.
5. Distinguish explicitly between safety and liveness requirements.
6. Reformulate some of the requirements to be more explicitly defining in terms of their behaviour. The requirements should be verifiable and not be trivial.
7. Rethink the "switch/continue" interaction in the architecture.
8. The "user inputs" shouldn't really be user inputs - they can be treated as external interactions with the system and need not be modelled per se as part of the system.
9. Mention the number of wafers that can be accommodated in the stacks.
