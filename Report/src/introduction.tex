The System Validation course of TU Delft proposes a project assignment concerning the design of a controller for a small distributed embedded system.
The goal of the assignment is to design, model, and verify a control system for a simplified machine that prepares wafers for the production of microchips.
Following the different stages of this project, we should be able to properly formulate system requirements and represent the model using labeled transition systems.
This document presents the constituent phases of the project. Chapter~\ref{chap:reqs} presents the components, the operating sequences and the requirements of the entire system. In chapter~\ref{chap:interact} we present the interactions taking place between the components defined in chapter~\ref{chap:reqs}. The architecture of the system is shown in chapter~\ref{chap:arch}. Chapter~\ref{chap:model} presents the modeled behaviour of all the controllers presented in the architecture. In chapter~\ref{chap:transReq} the model is verified with the translated requirements. Conclusions and other remarks are presented in chapter~\ref{chap:concl}.
